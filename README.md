# Markdown-Cheat-Sheet
This is just a cheet-sheet I made back when I was learning markdown.
Feel free to utilize it for your own learning or add to it if you feel it is missing something.
The .md file can be opened and edited or rendered in any markdown editor. 
You will need to download the 'tux.png' file as well and put it in the same directory as the markdown file in order for the file to render properly.
